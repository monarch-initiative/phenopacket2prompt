The patient was the first child of healthy and nonconsanguineous German parents. Polyhydramnios and
short extremities were observed on prenatal ultrasound.
He was born after an uneventful pregnancy in the 34th
gestational week with normal birth measurements
(length 43 cm, 10â€“25th centile; weight 2260 g, 30th centile; occipitofrontal head circumference 34 cm, 75th
centile). The patient had mild pulmonary stenosis.
He presented with recurrent respiratory infections, progressive short stature and
unusual facial features. Skeletal
survey at the age of 1 year and 3 months (Fig. 1) indicated severe brachydactyly,
with shortening of metacarpalia and phalanges. Bone age was severely delayed
and he showed poor diaphyseal modelling of the phalanges. The femur, humerus and ulna were short, which
had already been observed on prenatal ultrasound. As no
lateral radiography of the spine had been performed,
there was no information on vertebral anomalies.
On examination at the age of 15 months, our patient
presented with short stature [height 66 cm, 9 cm < 3rd
centile; weight 6870 g, 2000 g <3rd centile (corrected for
length: 25th centile)]; occipitofrontal head circumference
was normal (48.7 cm, 75th centile). Facial dysmorphism
included thin lip vermilion, long philtrum, a broad nasal
tip and bilateral ptosis (Fig. 2). The elbows and knees
were not fully extendable. Psychomotor development
was delayed; he could neither walk nor talk at that age.
