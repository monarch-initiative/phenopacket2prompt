A male neonate was born to term at the 40th week of gestation by cesarean section delivery after an uneventful pregnancy.
His birth weight was 3990g and Apgar score was 9/10. At day 1 post-term, he developed a pneumothorax and was admitted
to the perinatal intensive care unit for extra oxygen and parenteral fluid therapy. At day 4 post-term, abnormal movements,
stiffness of the muscles and convulsions were observed, and phenobarbital therapy was initiated. A neurogical investigation
described dyskinesia. At day 11 post-term, he was hospitalized in a developmental neurology ward. An examination did not
identify any hypoxia-induced regulatory abnormalities. The observed recurrent muscular hypertonia was attributed to a
suspected ion channel disorder and carbamazepine therapy was initiated.
Ultrasonography of his hip indicated the possibility of dysplasia on the left side, and ultrasonography of his abdomen
revealed bilateral mild pyelectasis. The results of neurosonography, electroencephalography and magnetic resonance
imaging of the head did not indicate any abnormalities of the central nervous system.
