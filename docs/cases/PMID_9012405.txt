The index case (TTD6VI), a male born at term from
first-cousin marriage (birth wt 3,110 g), was examined
first at birth, when he was found to have congenital
ichthyosis (collodion baby). The skin condition improved within 3 wk. leaving a mild ichthyosis of the
trunk. TTD6VI was clinically evaluated regularly during
his 1st year and then at the ages of 2, 4, 6, and 10 years.
An electron-microscopy study showed the accumulation
of intracellular lipid mortar and an increased number in
the stratum corneum, corresponding to an increase in
lamellar bodies in the stratum granulosum (Taieb et al.
1987). A diagnosis was suspected at 3 years of
age, on the basis of the following clinical manifestations:
mild ichthyosis of the trunk, with involvement of scalp,
palms, and soles; mild photosensitivity, noted during the
summer of 1988; lack of second upper incisor; and hair
growing normally but coarse and with a tiger-tail pattern under polarized light (van Neste et al. 1989).
 Other findings included normal intelligence
and lower-limit growth (-2 SD), normal neurological
examination, salt-and-pepper appearance of ophthalmic
fundi, normal bone X-ray survey, negative phototesting
(followed, however, by a finding of massive desquamation), and elevated (350 IU/liter) IgE levels.
