This boy was the only child born to unrelated Austrian parents. He was severely hypotonic in the neonatal
period with poor suck, resulting in faltering growth and delayed acquisition of motor milestones, rolling
first at three-and-a-half years. He has mild craniofacial dysmorphism with an elongated face, prominent
metopic ridge, tent-shaped mouth with long philtrum, low-set large ears and tapering fingers. Skeletal
anomalies include bilateral coxa vara anteverta and left developmental dysplasia of the hip requiring
surgical remediation. At age four years and eight months he has severe global developmental delay
(virtually non-ambulatory, babbles only, no speech), severe central and peripheral hypotonia, severe failure
to thrive but no microcephaly. MRI neuroimaging at 10 months of age, reported by the local radiologist,
showed slit lateral ventricles (first seen on neonatal cranial ultrasound) with generalized cerebral volume
loss and a hypoplastic corpus callosum (Fig. 2). Myelination appears appropriate for age.
