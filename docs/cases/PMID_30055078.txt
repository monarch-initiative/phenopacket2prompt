The index patient is a 13-year-old boy who was born at 37 weeks of gestation
to unrelated healthy parents of Finnish descent. Pregnancy and delivery were uncomplicated
and birth measurements were normal: weight of 3.38 kg (+0.1 SD), length 50 cm (+0.1 SD)
and OFC 33 cm. Already at 12 months he was overweight with weight 12.2 kg (+2.2 SD) and
length 77.6 cm (+0.8 SD) (body mass index (BMI) 20.3 kg/m2, BMI Z-score +2.3) and by 2
years his BMI Z-score had increased to +3.8 (weight +3.5 SD, length +1.1 SD) (Figure 1a).
Parents reported hyperphagia, food seeking behavior, and impaired satiety. Presently at the
age of 13.8 years, he is obese with weight 82.1 kg and height 163.1 cm (BMI 31 kg/m2, BMI
Z-score +2.8), and waist circumference 104.5 cm. His parents have normal
weight (mother’s BMI 23 kg/m2 and father’s 25 kg/m2). His 9-year-old sister has normal BMI
(Z score +1.6) and normal development. In addition to severe obesity, his neurological, cognitive and motor development were
delayed. He presented with delayed speech, clumsiness, problems with balance, and
strabismus. He was diagnosed with attention deficit and hyperactivity but had no aggressive
behavior. He did not present with any dysmorphic features. Brain MRI at 4 years was normal
and showed no hypothalamic or pituitary pathology. An electroencephalography EEG was
also normal. He attends a special needs school.
Laboratory investigations during childhood excluded hypothyroidism, hypercortisolism,
and metabolic abnormalities. Fasting blood concentrations of glucose, insulin, cholesterol,
and triglycerides were within normal range. Karyotype and screening for Prader-Willi and
Fragile-X syndromes were normal.
