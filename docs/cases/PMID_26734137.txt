[text]
The male patient was born after an uneventful pregnancy by spontaneous delivery.
The parents are nonconsanguineous healthy Caucasians, and the patient has two elder and one younger healthy siblings.
Birth weight and length were 3430 g and 51 cm, respectively. He was fully breastfed the first 6 months and partly breastfed
until age 10.5 months. Growth and development milestones were normal including the ability to sit at 6 months, crawl, and stand up at 8 months.
At the age of 8 months, growth and weight stagnated, and he lost the ability to crawl and stand. There was no history of seizures.
The first clinical examination at 18 months revealed height −3 SD and weight −3.5 SD. Craniofacial features were not clearly dysmorphic,
but a triangular mouth and low ears were noted. Musculoskeletal examination showed a generally atrophic body with muscle weakness
and reduced subcutaneous fat, and signs of rickets with rachitic rosary, lack of tooth eruption, palpable widening of distal radius,
and double malleoli. Biochemical tests (normal intervals in parenthesis) showed markedly decreased ionized serum calcium 1.08 mmol/L (1.20–1.35 mmol/L),
serum phosphate 0.72 mmol/L (1.20–1.80 mmol/L) and 1,25(OH)2D 24 pmol/L (adults 71–177pmol/L),
normal serum chloride 107 mmol/L (102–112 mmol/L) and increased serum alkaline phosphatase 14020U/L (55–515U/L), PTH 57.0 pmol/L (1.1–6.9 pmol/L),
and serum 25‐(OH)D 96 nmol/L (adults: 37–120 pmol/L with supplements and 10–66 without).
Twenty‐four‐hour urine showed signs of phosphate wasting with tubular reabsorption of 65% (normally above 80%), low calcium excretion, ketoaciduria,
and hyperaminoaciduria. There was a tendency toward metabolic acidosis with negative base excess of −5. According to the medical record,
radiologic findings included general rough halisteresis of all bones with severe cupping of metaphyses, poorly defined bone nuclei,
and subperiosteal bleedings. There were fractures of both ulna and tibia with visible fracture lines and callus.
Chest X‐ray was described with rachitic rosary, and otherwise normal heart and lung findings.
At 18 years of age, the patient reported having experienced bone pain and general malaise.
