The proband was male, aged 19 months. He was delivered at the 39th gestational week by cesarean section. 
Birth weight and length were 3.35 kg and 51 cm, respectively. The neuromotor development was normal from birth to date.
The patient had no family history of diabetes.
More than half a month before admission, the patient developed unprovoked polyuria and polydipsia.
2 days before admission, the child suffered from severe wheezing with Kussmaul breathing and poor general condition.
His random blood glucose levels were 40 mmol/L, and his urine ketone body was positive. On arrival at the emergency unit,
the intravenous blood glucose level was 20.74 mmol/L, and blood gas analysis resulted in pH 7.07, PCO2 17.5 mm Hg, BE – 23.5 mmol/L,
then the patient was admitted to the endocrinology department for further treatment.
2.1. Physical examination on admission
Patient’s temperature was 37℃, respiration rate was 37 times/min, pulse was 150 times/min, and blood pressure was 116/62 mm Hg.
The patient’s weight was 12 kg with normal physical development. He was in poor general condition, with a decreased level of consciousness,
no tears when crying, an anemic appearance, Kussmaul respiration, and a fruity breath odor. His lips and skin were dry with slightly
low skin elasticity. The right upper lung presented with moist carackles. The upper extremities were cool to the elbows,
while the lower extremities were cool to the knees, with a dilated blood vessel pattern on the limbs and a CRT of 3 seconds.
2.2. Laboratory and imaging results on admission.
The blood sugar was 21.69 mmol/L (3.9–6.1 mmol/L), and glycosylated hemoglobin was 11.1% (4–6%). At the 0th minute, the insulin
level was 0.56 μIU/mL (6.0–27.0 μIU/mL), C-peptide level was 0.09 ng/mL (1.1–5.0 ng/mL).
Anti-islet cell and anti-glutamate decarboxylase antibodies were negative. Blood gas analysis repeated: pH 7.06, PCO2 15mm Hg, PO2 74 mm Hg.
Urine routine analyses showed that the glucose was 4+, ketone was 3+, and the protein was 1+. Cortisol and thyroid function tests are normal.
Chest X-ray showed slightly more texture and fuzziness in the lungs with a patchy shadow on the right upper lung.
Abdominal ultrasound showed no abnormalities.
