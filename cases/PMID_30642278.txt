A 15-year-old boy was admitted to the laboratory of clinical genetics of Peking Union Medical College Hospital for genetic
counseling due to congenital cataracts. In addition to the primary physical characteristic of congenital bilateral nuclear cataracts,
the young patient had a long-narrow face, prominent nose and large anteverted pinnae, screw-driver like incisors,
mild mulberry like molars, one missing maxillary second molar and malocclusion (Fig. 1). Available clinical information
regarding the families is shown in Table 1, and the carrier females lens opacity and vision were unavailable here.
The proband (III:1) and another affected individual (II:5) underwent microincision cataract surgery at the ages of 15
and 21 years respectively. Available photos before the surgery revealed bilateral lens opacities that heavily affected
the nucleus in the proband (Fig. 1; Fig. 2). Individual II:5 presented with similar facial features including a long narrow face,
mildly anteverted pinnae ear and screw-driver like incisors, mild mulberry like molars and malocclusion (Additional file 1).
Individual II: 5 stated that he was affected by nystagmus, and at the time of recruitment in our study, which might associate with NHS.
However, neither of these individuals had mental retardation or behavioral disturbances.
Their family history revealed no obvious visual defects or dental abnormalities among the rest of the family members.
