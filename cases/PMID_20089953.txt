The proband (Patient III-4) was a 4-year-old girl who was delivered at term by cesarean
section owing to the breech position. She weighed 2720 g (6 lb) (10th percentile) at
birth and had a wide anterior fontanelle; bilateral fractures of the humeri, radii,
ulnae, femora, and tibiae were noted on radiographs. She was able to sit independently
at the age of 2.75 years and was able to walk at the age of 3.5 years with the use of
long leg braces and a walker. Postnatal fractures began to occur when she reached 6
months of age; she sustained six long-bone fractures and underwent four lower-extremity
osteotomy procedures. Her growth curve fell below normal by the age of 6 months.
At 28 months of age, her weight and length were both at the 50th percentile for a
normal 9-month-old girl. She had generalized, moderate ligamentous laxity, triangular
facies with a high-bossed forehead, and proptosis. An umbilical hernia was noted at
the age of 5 months. She had bilateral pes planus. Skeletal radiographs obtained when
she was a newborn revealed osteoporotic long bones, with undertubulation and bowing of
the femora and tibiae (Figure 1B, top row). By the age of 15 months, the vertebral
bodies of T11 through L2 showed substantial anterior compression. At 33 months,
long-bone undertubulation had improved but was still present in the femoral metaphyses.
The z score for L1 to L4 on dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) was âˆ’3.9 at the age
of 3.5 years.
